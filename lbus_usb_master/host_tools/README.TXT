Lib and tool for issuing LBUS requests using the USB busmaster

This is still very much work in progress. Expect APIs to break

Use the "lbus-tool" to issue queries/commands via LBUS.

For the library and its API, take a look into lbuscomm.h

Requirements for compiling:

- libusb >= 1.0
- lua (tested for 5.2)


Lua API:

updated, yet to be documented.
